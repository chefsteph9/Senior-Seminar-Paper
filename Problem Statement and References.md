## Problem Statement
**Problem:** It's hard to find someone that's fallen overboard in the ocean.  
**Barrier:** Ocean currents can move a person miles from where they fell overboard.  
**Solution:** Create software that can predict where a person will be based on OSCAR and time (or time range) that they fell overboard.

*Slightly revised 1-4-16*  
**Problem**
It is difficult to track where a person that has fallen overboard in the ocean might be.

**Barriers**
The exact time the person fell is often unknown, and ocean currents move the person from their original location to unknown places.

**Solution**
Create a program that can figure out a person's likely location given the time range of when they fell overboard, using the ship's location history and ocean current data gathered from NASA's OSCAR program (**O**cean **S**urface **C**urrent **A**nalyses **R**ealtime) and can create a route file that can be uploaded to Universal Ground Control Software to guide Seach and Rescue drones to the location.
